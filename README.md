# vB5-Manual

A vBulletin Documentation project using the [Grav](https://getgrav.com) flat-file CMS. Grav uses a series of markdown files and templates to present its content. Due to this, most pages of the documentation are viewable in this repository. The site can be viewed in its complete form at the [vB5 Support](http://vb5support.com) website.

To use this, download and install the Grav CMS system. Then copy these four folders into the /user directory and overwrite the files there.
