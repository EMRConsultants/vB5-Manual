Disabling a BB code tag will prevent it from working anywhere on the forum, including signatures, private messages, user notes etc.

## Maximum [CODE] Lines
When a user posts a block of [CODE], [PHP] or [HTML] in one of their messages, the system will place it in a box, which expands to contain their message.<br />
