## What is a Page?

As you’ve looked through vBulletin 5, you’ve probably noticed several mentions of Pages and wondered what we were talking about. In this article, we’ll try to shed some light on what Pages are in vBulletin and how you can use them.

It’s pretty easy. In fact, you already know the basics of what a Page is. You’re on one right now. At its simplest, a Page is just like the pages you find in any other webpage. The only difference with vBulletin is that you can add and edit the content of the page directly without having to upload HTML or CSS files to your webhost. (That is, you can if you have admin permissions.) 

The new vBulletin interface allows you to add new pages in addition to changing the content on each individual page.
