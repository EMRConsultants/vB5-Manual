## Require Infraction Message
This option requires that the user sending an infraction include a PM or Email, depending on your forum settings.

## Post Reporting Discussion Forum
A discussion topic can be created for each reported post for moderators to discuss the post further.  Choose a forum for the discussion topics to be created in.

## Post Reporting User
Reported post discussion topics default to being posted under the username of the reporter. To have the topics reported under another username, enter an existing username.

## Post Reporting Email
This option sends an email to the specified users when a post is reported. <br />
Users with an active device token will also receive push notifications about the report if <a href="admincp/options.php?do=options&amp;dogroup=api">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a> is enabled.
