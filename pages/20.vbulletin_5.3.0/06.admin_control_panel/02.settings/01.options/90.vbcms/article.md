## Default CMS Preview Length in Characters
By default, this many characters from the beginning of an article will be displayed for the preview. You can change this for an individual article by setting the previewbreak in the editor.

## Article Preview Image Size
When you create a Text article, the first image attachment found will be used to generate a preview image shown in the category. This setting determines the size for that preview image.<br /><br />Available sizes are determined by the <a href="admincp/options.php?do=options&amp;dogroup=attachment#attachresizes">Attachment Resize Options</a>.
