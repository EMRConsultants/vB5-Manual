## Forum Name
Name of your forum. This appears in the title of every forum page.

## vBulletin URL
This is the URL, or web address, that users will use in their bookmarks or address bar to access your site.<br />
Note: do not add a trailing slash. ('/')

## Login URL
Only used for secure logins. This is the SSL or HTTPS mirror of your site. If you're unsure of this address, contact your hosting provider. If you're not using secure logins, do not change this setting.

## Core URL
The location of your core directory. This directory contains the vBulletin engine and is not public. Do not update unless directed to by vBulletin Support.

## HTTPS terminates before the webserver
Select this option if your network is configured so that HTTPS terminates before the request is sent to the webserver.  This has no effect if the site/login urls are not set to use HTTPS.

## Route Channels and Conversations by Node ID
Use the simplified URL node/xxxx for all channels and conversations (including Forums, Blogs, Social Groups, and Articles). This can be useful if the title values for these node used in the URL cause problems on your site.<br/><br/>

Note that this will override any custom urls configured for Channel or Conversation pages.

## Header Logo URL
If you would like to customize the URL that the logo image in the header links to, please enter the URL here.<br /><br />

Leave this option blank to use the "vBulletin URL" specified above.

## Always use Forum URL as Base Path
If this is set to 'Yes' the Forum URL will always be used for links instead of the current URL.  This ensures that links are consistent but may not be desirable if you use multiple domains or a mix of http and https.

## Redirect Domain Whitelist
Optional, advanced additional URL configuration. This setting should remain blank for most installations. Specify additional domains of your forum:<br />

Examples:<br />
http://www.example2.com<br />
http://www.example.com<br />

Note: do not add a trailing slash. ('/')
