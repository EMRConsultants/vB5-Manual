A module are the building blocks of vBulletin 5 Connect's Site Builder system. Using Modules the site administrator can control the content that is displayed on pages throughout the system. There are two types of modules. Admin Modules and System Modules. Admin Modules are the ones that the administrator can add, edit, and delete from pages. They can be used to create custom pages for a variety of reasons. Using the options provided, they allow the site administrator to change how pages look and work, giving them design control over the site and what it does.
