## What is the Footer?
The footer is a list of navigation links that appears at the bottom of the site. With Site Builder, you’re able to add links to the footer that can take your users anywhere you want them to go. These items behave similarly to Navigation Links in the Navigation Bar. Unlike the Navigation Bar, the footer doesn't allow for sub-navigation menus to be created. Any changes to the Footer are global and apply to all pages.

## How to add a Footer Link
If Site Builder is not active, turn the system on by clicking the [button="sb-editsite"]Edit Site[/button] button to the right of your username.

This will open the Footer Editor under the Site Builder Menu. Within the editor, click the [button="sb-bluebutton"]New Navigation Item[/button] link. A dialog will appear where you can enter the name of the Navigation Link and the location you want it to point to. Once you’re done adding items, click the “Save Changes” link and your page will reload with the changes.

### Formatting your URLs
- If you are creating a link to a location outside of vBulletin, you must use a fully qualified URL. E.g.: https://example.com/mylink.html. 
- If you are linking to a page within the vBulletin system, you can use the page name. E.g.: articles to link to the articles page.

### Footer Link Permissions
If you wish to have the link visible to specific usergroups, then click on the Edit link under usergroups and select the boxes you want the link to appear to. To have the link appear to all usergroups, leave the boxes empty.

## How to edit a Footer Link
If Site Builder is not active, turn the system on by clicking the [button="sb-editsite"]Edit Site[/button] button to the right of your username.

Find the navigation item you want to edit and click the Edit ([fa=fa-pencil]) icon to the right of its name. This will open a dialog that allows you to change the name, the URL and the permissions of Footer Link. When you’re done making your changes, click on [button="sb-editorbutton"]Save Changes[/button] at the top of the Footer editor.

## How to Remove a Footer Item
If Site Builder is not active, turn the system on by clicking the [button="sb-editsite"]Edit Site[/button] button to the right of your username.

Click on the ‘Footer’ button. This will open form beneath the menu bar. From here, click on the Delete ([fa=fa-trash-o]) icon to the right of the Footer Link that you want to remove. When you’re done making your changes, click on [button="sb-editorbutton"]Save Changes[/button] at the top of the Footer editor.
